<p> I learned how to creat car code. I like that its my dream car the hennesy red eye hellcat. The car has 1000 horse power and goes from 0 to 60 in 2.8 seconds. I dont really understand how the code works. It uses event listeners to detect when you press w a s or d and moves the car up down left or right.</p>
