<p>Dead men
A dead man walks up to you and says hi,
A dead man tucks you in and sings you a lullaby.
A dead man shakes your hand,
A dead man stands by your side,
That dead man is alive,

Mouth foaming, groaning whistle hobbling closer,
Unfortunate circumstances befell this dead man,
That dead man looks at me,
Pupils dilate, lsd,
Open eyes that do not see,

That dead man walks away,
Phones record the dead man’s final day,
As that dead man takes his rest,
That dead man was depressed,
Unfortunate circumstances befell this dead man,

This dead man worked at a bank,
He was an accountant,
Counting money he could never have,
Getting paid a generous sum,
Still not satisfied,
This dead man had a wife,
He still saw beauty in others,
He wanted women who he could never have,
He was still not satisfied,
This dead man had two kids,
One an athlete and one an artist,
He wanted them to be scholars,
He was still not satisfied

The dead man stole from his job,
His nerve broke,
Envy and greed,
The dead man was satisfied,
The dead man cheated on his wife,
Lust and desire,
The dead man was satisfied,
The dead man hit his kids,
They began to study,
The dead man was satisfied,

The kids hated the dead man,
Feeling repressed and abused,
The wife left the dead man,
Feeling sad and confused,
A knock on the door,
The dead man faced jail time,
The dead man was no longer satisfied,

Once he was out he was no longer alive,
The dead man had no place to live,
No kids to be proud of,
No wife to love,
No job to go to,
The dead mad had one thing,
A small tablet was given to the dead man,
His brain rewired,
The dead man was only alive when the tab touched his tongue,

The dead man took his final rest,
He sat apon his fabric throne,
He drew his final breath,
The flashing of an ambulance,
Only now helping the dead man,
To everyone around this man never lived,
No one mourned him,
No one cried,
This dead man never died,
But this dead man wasn’t always a dead man,
