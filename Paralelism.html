<p>Parallelism
I run from myself, I run from my mouth. Who am I never truly defined. Life untrue a mirror image of me people see. Different tints different shapes like a clown house. Stretched, warped, smushed. True stories still played in reversed view. I’m spiraling out of control lies spin me dizzy jumping from person to person. Multiplayer life is hard to manage. I multitask to maintain this act. Many expressions held at once. Face disfigured once lies congregate. How did it start so pathologically? These weren’t always lies just truths unfinished. Now I walk the maze of mirrors. I run into myself and stumble. No way out without breaking the mirror. Smash mirror broken hand bleeding. Dripping on the ground. I look down and see a mirror stained with blood. Tainted that’s not me. It mimics my movements all the same. Smash. Glass crashes I see a crack in my own vision. I fall to the ground looking up at myself breaking the glass. He’s still running. Scared of who he is. He runs from himself. He runs from his mouth. He runs straight into the mirror.
