   <p>Blue sweater
The wind blows,
A brisk coffee breeze,
Gods fan blows above,
And the street starts to mirror Eden.
Shiver, shiver,
To your right is her,

“Are you cold”
“N-n-no”
Blue sweater lined with leather
Jersey number makes it better
Wrapped around you like a fleece

Cold nights moonlight laminates,
Cascading off of the building and onto her face,
A face of superfluous beauty,
Skin fair, hair of a golden hue,
Ice eyes stare back at you,

Cold air still their,
“You sure it’s- frigid”
“I’m sure”
Nose runny you see,
Wind blows through their jacket,
And frost enthralls the heart.

As a blue sweater gives you warmth,
Blue sweater laced with leather,
Tightly tethered,
Barely weathered,
Never shared.

Shiver shiver shiver,
“You sure you’re not cold?”
“Positive”
Their hands shake and skin cracks,
Their beauty is still in tact,
The cold takes its toll

The night sky,
you stare at the stars and it seams like someone is staring back,
The worlds vibe shifts,
You share a laugh,
She smiles,
Lips cracked by the cold,

Blue sweater lined with leather,
Football emblem makes it better,
Ripped off,
introduced to the cold,
As your arms are unveiled,
Now wrapped around her,

“Why’d you do that?”
“You were cold”
Blue sweater lined with leather,
Your signature makes it better,
Never shared until now,
The blue compliments their eyes,
And withdraws the icy disguise of the night,
Her beauty is unveiled and unmatched,

Blue sweater lined with leather,
They now make it better,
It was worth the pursuit,
The cold weather feels as if it subsides
As you see their eyes one last time
And see it again in the night sky

Blue sweater lined with leather,
Cold is bad but this is better,
Armory doors open,
I say goodbye to the wind and the cold,
Being hugged one more time by its breeze,
Warmth puts you both at ease,

They return the sweater,
Defrosted heart,
“Why’d you do that?”
“Because you were cold”
“I had a jacket”
“Sometimes you need a blue sweater laced with leather”</p>
